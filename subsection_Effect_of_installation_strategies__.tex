\subsection{Effect of installation strategies}
The number of lifting operations is highly affected by the type of installation strategy implemented in the logistics chain. We further investigate the three different installation strategies namely Rotor Star ($RS$), Single Blade ($SB$) and Bunny Ears ($BE$). The strategies differs only during the last phase of the logistics chain for both transport and installation phase. The capacity of the vessel is limited to transport one complete set of turbine to the offshore site to be installed at the offshore site.

The probabilistic approach has been considered to carry out the comparison on the completion time of the project for 60 OWTs. As shown on Fig. \ref{fig:strategies}, on average $SB$ is better of 0.7 \% than $RS$, $RS$ is better of 5\% than $BE$, $SB$ is better of 5.7 \% than $BE$. By far it has been found out that the $SB$ is the best option considering the total project lead time to install 60 OWTs. The results did not show a significant difference between the three strategies due to the fact that the jack-up vessel that will transport and install the turbines is limited to a capacity of one set of turbine components.
