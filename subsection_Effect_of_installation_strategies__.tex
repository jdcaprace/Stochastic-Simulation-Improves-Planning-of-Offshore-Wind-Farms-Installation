\subsection{Effect of installation strategies}
The number of lifting operations is highly affected by the type of installation strategy implemented in the logistics chain. We further investigate the three different installation strategies namely Rotor Star ($RS$), Single Blade ($SB$) and Bunny Ears ($BE$). The strategies differ only during the last phase of the logistics chain for both transport and installation phase. The capacity of the vessel is limited to transport one complete set of turbine to the offshore site to be installed at the offshore site.

The probabilistic approach has been considered to carry out the comparison on the completion time of the project for 60 OWTs. As shown on Fig. \ref{fig:strategies}, $RS$ and $SB$ are relatively similar while $SB$ is better of 5.7 \% than $BE$. By far it has been found out that the $SB$ and $RS$ are best options considering the total project lead time. Higher discrepancies between the strategies can be highlighted if the capacity of the jack-up vessel to transport and install the OWTs is increased.%, i.e. higher than the capacity of one set of OWT components.
