\subsection{Effect of installation strategies}
The number of lifts is highly affected by the type of installation strategy implemented in the logistics chain. We further investigate the three different installation strategies namely Rotor star, Single Blade and Bunny ears. The only difference existing among the three mentioned installation strategies is during the last phase of the logistics chain that is the transport and installation phase. The capacity of the vessel is limited to transporting one complete set of turbine to the offshore site to be installed at the offshore site.

The probablstic approach has been consider to carry out the comparision on the completion of the project for 60 OWT and on average Single blade is better of 0.7 \% than Rotor star, Rotor Star is better of 5 \% than Bunny Ear, Single Blade is better of 5.7 \% than Bunny Ear. By far it has been found out that the single blade is the best option considering the total project lead time to install 60 wind turbines at the offshore site. The results did not show a significant difference between the three strategies due to the fact that the jack up vessel that will transport and install the turbines is limited to a capacity of one set of turbine components.
