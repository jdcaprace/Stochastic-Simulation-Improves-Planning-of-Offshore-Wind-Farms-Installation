\textbf{Purpose} --
This paper presents the development of a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) of OWFs installation coupled to metocean data. The development of tools taking into account all the variables including distance between ports and installation sites, wind speed, wave height and sea state parameters. An historical weather data model and a probabilistic approaches have been cross validated. Both models are based on time series and layout configuration of the Thorntonbank OWF located at 30 km of the Belgian coast (latitude 51° 38′ 39″ North, longitude 2° 55′ 38″ East), in water ranging from 12 to 27 meters deep, see Fig \ref{fig:map}.

The model is able to take into account the effects of weather on the installation cycle, to assess the likelihood of delays of a certain process and to propose alternatives to minimize the effects of these delays. By evaluating different sets of weather data, the overall installation process can be optimized with respect to shortest installation times and highest robustness of the schedule.

%The present paper, unlike other research work, presents a DES of the installation of OWFs that is using real weather data of a specific site. This makes the results of the simulation way more precise and allows to validate other simulations results that are using imprecise seasonal weather forecasts. Since the methodology rely on real weather data, the planning tool may be used during the operational phase of constructing or operating a wind farm. Thus it would be used as a day to day simulator in order to support real-time decisions.
