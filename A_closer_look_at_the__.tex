Fig. \ref{fig:seasonaleffect} gives a closer look to the influences of the number of OFTs on the installation lead time depending of seasons. Winter (1st March) and summer (1st July) are considered for the starting date of the project. Increment of the number of OWT is draw up against the increment of lead time in days. It can be observed that for a small number of OWTs (inferior to 40), it would be preferable to start the project during winter while for high number of OWTs (superior to 40) it is preferable to start the project during summer. Another option could be to split the project in two phases having less than 40 OWTs each. The justification about these differences can be supported by the fact that if we start in winter for lower number of turbines, the project could be completed before the next winter appears. It is not the case for more than 40 OWTs.
