\subsection{Model description}
There are four distinct phases in the logistics chain considered in the simulation model.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pre-pilling phase -- Height piles are loaded to the transport ship or feeder vessel at port and transported to the offshore site. Then, four piles are transfered to the jack-up vessel. Finally, piles are driven one by one into the sea bed. The transport ship or feeder vessel waits until the first set of piles have been driven into the sea bed. Then the second set of four piles are transfered to the jack-up vessel. At this point the feeder vessel can sail back to the port while the jack-up vessel keeps installing the transferred piles. Here, it should be noted that the feeder vessel after being loaded can only leave the port if and only if the weather is good enough based on workability and time window requirements for the transport (condition 1) and transfer of the four piles onto the jack up vessel (condition 2). The weather is to be checked for each pile to be driven one by one.
\item Jacket phase -- this is the second phase in the work flow and it starts after n=5x4 (one pile per turbine) piles have been driven at the offshore site. It is imperative that this kind of buffer will keep the jacket phase section active if something happens to the pre-pilling phase. The activities under this phase start by loading the 2 jacket foundation at the port and transport to the offshore site. At the offshore site, the foundations will be installed and grouted one by one. Grouting is the process of making a structural connection between a jacket and the piles that have been driven or drilled into the seabed.
\item Transport and assembly phase -- this is the third phase and it starts after m=5 jacket foundations have been installed and grouted at the offshore site. Here wind turbine components (blades, Towers, Nacelles, and Hubs) required for 3 OWTs will be loaded at the port and transported to the staging area close to the offshore site. At the staging area, components will be unloaded, stored and assembled if necessary. There is a limitation for storing the components at the staging area and maximum equal to 5 OWTs.
\item Installation phase -- this is the last phase considered in the logistics work flow where components required for one OWT will be loaded onto the jack up vessel and transported to the offshore site.  The jackup vessel will install the parts of the OWT one by one at the offshore site and sail back to the staging area until all the OWTs will be installed.
