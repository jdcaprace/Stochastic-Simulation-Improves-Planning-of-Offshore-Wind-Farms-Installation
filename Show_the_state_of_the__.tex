\textbf{State of the art} --
Research on OWFs, which until now has been carried out by various institutions, were mainly based on the technical challenges in the design and manufacture of the facilities, \cite{Miller2013}, \cite{SerranoGonzalez2014}, \cite{Perveen2014}. Nevertheless, there is only little research that addresses logistical problems in production, installation, operation, maintenance (spare parts logistics) and disassembly (reverse logistics) of offshore facilities, \cite{Scholz2010}, \cite{Lange2012}, \cite{COMPIT11}, \cite{COMPIT12}, \cite{aitsimulation}, \cite{thalji2012}.

Recently they have been significant advances in Operation and Maintenance (O\&M) while, in contrast, few publications address the logistical problem of manufacturing and installation of OWFs.

%O&M
\cite{dinwoodie2013} developed an econometric O\&M model to determine where different operational choices represent the cost optimal solution. The sensitivity of operational strategies to OWFs size, failure rate of major components and weather conditions have been examined. A multivariate Auto-Regressive climate model were used. This methodology maintains seasonality and correlation between wind and wave time series. However the model fail to capture outliers and data behavior over 17 $m/s$.


\cite{Hagen2013} and \cite{scheu2012} developed  a multivariate stochastic weather models in order to generate sea state time series based on observed time series or historical data and validated for Simulation of O\&M in Offshore Wind Farms. 


Typian et al. provided a comparison study of two different mathematical methods for estimating weather downtime and operation times using the Markov Theory and Monte Carlo Simulation, \cite{Tyapin2011}. However this approach is limited to one offshore wind turbine and focuses on operation control.




A real scheduling approach was given by \cite{Scholz2010}, who developed a heuristic for the scheduling of offshore installation processes. The current weather situations as well as transport capacity limits of the installation vessel were considered.



\cite{ISOPE2012} presented a further going approach for offshore scheduling, which also integrated the inventory control and supply of the installation port.




\cite{Hofmann2014} ...pointed out that simulation helps to quantify the cost of Operation \& Maintenance  and also indicated that larger wind turbines can lead to lower O\&M costs.It was also concluded that higher failure rates and maintenance durations quite fast will counterbalance the benefits of larger wind turbines. Already a simultaneous increase of failure rates and maintenance durations by 25 \% will lead to higher O\&M cost for a wind farm with 10 MW wind turbines compared to a 5 MW turbine wind farm. 



The problem of offshore maintenance scheduling was treated by \cite{Kovacs2011497}, who developed a mixed-integer program (MIP), which constituted a module of an integrated framework for condition monitoring, diagnosis and maintenance. The idea of this approach is to find the best time for maintenance operations in relation to performance of the wind turbine and the availability of
the service capacities.

The planning and scheduling problem of OWFs considering weather data belongs to the NP-hard problems (Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard), \cite{leeuwen1990}. It explains why no suitable planning tools for the installation of offshore equipments has been introduced in the literature up to now. 

Nevertheless, models in literature show some interesting aspects to the installation planning of OWFs using statistical approaches, but do not consider real weather data. The present paper, unlike other research work, presents a DES of the installation of OWFs that is using real weather data of a specific site. This makes the results of the simulation way more precise and allows to validate other simulations results that are using imprecise seasonal weather forecasts. Since the methodology rely on real weather data, the planning tool may be used during the operational phase of constructing or operating a wind farm. Thus it would be used as a day to day simulator in order to support real-time decisions.
