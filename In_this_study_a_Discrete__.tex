In this study, a Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) approach coupled with a metocean model is implemented in order to identify possible improvements for the scheduling of the installation of OWFs. In this respect, the major aspects that influence the installation activities are modelled in a comprehensive manner. In addition, an advanced logistic supply chain model is developed to support the OWFs developers in the decision stage. In this context, Fig. \ref{fig:SimulationModel} shows the flowchart of the methodology illustrating the information flow between the different modules.

The developed methodology is divided into ????? main sections: ???, ???, ???, ???, ...
