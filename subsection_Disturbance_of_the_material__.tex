\subsection{Disturbance of the material process flow}
Other disturbances than the weather conditions have been identified in the material flow process. These disturbances will be a source of additional delays in the supply chain. Amongst these disturbances we find the probability of resource failure, the probability to have missing materials and components, the probability not having enough workforce, the probability to reach the maximum level of storage surface in the port, etc. In the simulation, these probabilities are expressed as stochastic distribution in order to take into account the incertitude of the input parameters. In that way, the risk on the variance of the schedule can be evaluated.
