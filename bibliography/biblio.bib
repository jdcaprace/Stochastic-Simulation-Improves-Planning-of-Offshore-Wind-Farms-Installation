  abstract = {Nowadays, EU shipyards that are facing difficulties due to the global crisis are often trying to diversify their activities. Some of them have already turned to the production of offshore windmill components. The installation and operation of offshore windmills are much more complex than onshore due to the distance and the depth of the water column. This creates problems specific to the production, installation and maintenance of offshore wind turbines. A tool for sequencing and installation simulation has been developed to assess the risks associated to the assembly of wind turbines parks via simulations of the different phases of construction considering various random phenomena such as weather conditions and uncertainties on production time.},

  abstract = {Abstract A multivariate Markov chain model is presented for generating sea state time series based on observed time series. The sea state is represented by the wave height, wind speed, wave period, wind direction and wave direction. Two ways of capturing the seasonal variation in the sea state parameters resulted in two distinct models. Their quality was assessed by comparing their statistical properties to what was obtained from observed time series. In one of the models (Model 1) transition probabilities were estimated separately for each month, while in the other (Model 2) a monthly transformation of the data were performed. Two different sea state data sets were considered in the validation, and it was found that both models compared favorably to the empirical data. It was concluded that Model 1 worked best for the longest data set considered, but was challenged by the shorter time series, where Model 2 worked best. Model 2 uses the observed data more efficiently, but relies on stationarity after removing the monthly variability. This seems to be a reasonable approximation for the data considered. The effect of changing the wave height resolution in the modeled time series was also investigated.},

  abstract = {Abstract Larger wind turbines are believed to be advantageous from an investment and installation perspective, since costs for installation and inner cabling are dependent mainly on the number of wind turbines and not their size. Analogously, scaling up the turbines may also be argued to be advantageous from an operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) perspective. For a given total power production of the wind farm, larger wind turbines give a smaller number of individual machines that needs to be maintained and could therefore give smaller O&amp;M costs. However, the O&amp;M costs are directly dependent on how failure rates, spare part costs, and time needed by technicians to perform each maintenance task and will develop for larger wind turbines. A simulation study is carried out with a discrete-event simulation model for the operational phase of an offshore wind farm, comparing the O&amp;M costs of a wind farm consisting of 5 \{MW\} turbines with a wind farm consisting of 10 \{MW\} turbines. Simulation results confirm that O&amp;M costs decrease when replacing two 5 \{MW\} turbines by one 10 \{MW\} turbine, if the total production capacity and all other parameters are kept equal. However, whether larger wind turbines can contribute to a reduction of cost of energy from an O&amp;M perspective is first and foremost dependent on how the failure rates and maintenance durations for such wind turbines will develop compared to 5 \{MW\} wind turbines. Based on the results of this analysis, it is concluded that higher failure rates and maintenance durations rapidly are counterbalancing the benefits of larger wind turbines.},

It has developed significantly since the inception of computer simulation in the 1950s, most of this in line with developments in computing. The progress of simulation from its early days is charted with a particular focus on recent history. Specific developments in the past 15 years include visual interactive modelling, simulation optimization, virtual reality, integration with other software, simulation in the service sector, distributed simulation and the use of the worldwide web. The future is then speculated upon. Potential changes in model development, model use, the domain of application for simulation and integration with other simulation approaches are all discussed. The desirability of continuing to follow developments in computing, without significant developments in the wider methodology of simulation, is questioned.},

Participants are asked to build simulation models based on a case study and to think aloud while modelling. The generated verbal protocols are divided into seven modelling topics: problem structuring, conceptual modelling, data inputs, model coding, verification &amp; validation, results &amp; experimentation and implementation and then analyzed. Our results suggest that all modellers switch between modelling topics, however \{DES\} modellers follow a more linear progression. \{DES\} modellers focus significantly more on model coding and verification &amp; validation, whereas \{SD\} modellers on conceptual modelling. Observations are made revealing some interesting differences in the way the two groups of modellers tackle the case. This paper contributes towards the comparison of \{DES\} and SD.},

  abstract = {Abstract Hospitals aim at delivering efficient and effective healthcare. This requires high quality medical care, provided by highly trained and motivated professionals. Also the way operations are organized can contribute to a smoother healthcare delivery. An important point here is patient flow and waiting times during the patient trajectory diagnosis-therapy-care. Due to the large variability that exist between patients care needs, even for patients with a similar pathology, predicting the waiting times is very challenging. Traditional analytical optimization models like queuing theory cannot cope with the complexity of the pathways followed by patients and the interrelationships between the resources they need. Discrete event simulation can help to provide insight into the impact of operational changes, e.g. concerning available scanner capacity, on the timing of the patientâ€™s trajectory in a hospital unit. This paper focuses on the diagnostic part of the stay of stroke patients in a stroke unit of a university hospital. With the help of discrete event simulation this patient flow is analyzed and the impact of potential changes in the capacity profile of test resources is investigated. The paper describes the steps taken in the study and the challenges met. The structure of the simulation program is explained and the results of the scenario analysis are discussed. The paper starts with a brief exploration of the use of discrete event simulation in healthcare and ends with general observations on the subject.},

  abstract = {Abstract Important objectives and challenges in todayÅ‰s manufacturing environment include the introduction of new products variants and the designing and developing of reconfigurable manufacturing systems. Due to changing customer requirements, products development time is shorter and manufacturing systemsÅ‰ ability to physically reconfigure is important. The objective of this research is to investigate and support the reconfigurability of a manufacturing system by applying hybridized Agent-based and Discrete-Event simulation modelling technique. Emergent behaviour of the simulation model, when various modifications take place in the system, is examined. The benefits of this framework are decentralized control and collaborative decision making using the \{UML\} object-oriented modelling technique, flexible reaction to system changes in terms of product variety and possible system disturbances, and system performance improvement. AnyLogic multi-method simulation modelling platform is utilized to design and create different types of agents. The proposed simulation model results are demonstrated and verified in a case study using the configurable assembly Learning Factory (iFactory) in the Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (IMS) Center at the University of Windsor. The benefits and limitations of the proposed framework are discussed.},

Ready-for-simulation process model is built semi-automatically, expert only inputs desired environ ment variab les, which are used as features during the learning process. Process workflow is extracted as a Petri Net model using a combination of process mining algorithms. Dependencies between features and process variables are formalized using decision and regression trees techniques. Experiments were conducted to predict \{KPIs\} of real companies.},
