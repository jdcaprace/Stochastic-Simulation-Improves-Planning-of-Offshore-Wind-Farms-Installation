  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, EU shipyards that are facing difficulties due to the global crisis are often trying to diversify their activities. Some of them have already turned to the production of offshore windmill components. The installation and operation of offshore windmills are much more complex than onshore due to the distance and the depth of the water column. This creates problems specific to the production, installation and maintenance of offshore wind turbines. A tool for sequencing and installation simulation has been developed to assess the risks associated to the assembly of wind turbines parks via simulations of the different phases of construction considering various random phenomena such as weather conditions and uncertainties on production time.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A multivariate Markov chain model is presented for generating sea state time series based on observed time series. The sea state is represented by the wave height, wind speed, wave period, wind direction and wave direction. Two ways of capturing the seasonal variation in the sea state parameters resulted in two distinct models. Their quality was assessed by comparing their statistical properties to what was obtained from observed time series. In one of the models (Model 1) transition probabilities were estimated separately for each month, while in the other (Model 2) a monthly transformation of the data were performed. Two different sea state data sets were considered in the validation, and it was found that both models compared favorably to the empirical data. It was concluded that Model 1 worked best for the longest data set considered, but was challenged by the shorter time series, where Model 2 worked best. Model 2 uses the observed data more efficiently, but relies on stationarity after removing the monthly variability. This seems to be a reasonable approximation for the data considered. The effect of changing the wave height resolution in the modeled time series was also investigated. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Larger wind turbines are believed to be advantageous from an investment and installation perspective, since costs for installation and inner cabling are dependent mainly on the number of wind turbines and not their size. Analogously, scaling up the turbines may also be argued to be advantageous from an operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) perspective. For a given total power production of the wind farm, larger wind turbines give a smaller number of individual machines that needs to be maintained and could therefore give smaller O&amp;M costs. However, the O&amp;M costs are directly dependent on how failure rates, spare part costs, and time needed by technicians to perform each maintenance task and will develop for larger wind turbines. A simulation study is carried out with a discrete-event simulation model for the operational phase of an offshore wind farm, comparing the O&amp;M costs of a wind farm consisting of 5 \{MW\} turbines with a wind farm consisting of 10 \{MW\} turbines. Simulation results confirm that O&amp;M costs decrease when replacing two 5 \{MW\} turbines by one 10 \{MW\} turbine, if the total production capacity and all other parameters are kept equal. However, whether larger wind turbines can contribute to a reduction of cost of energy from an O&amp;M perspective is first and foremost dependent on how the failure rates and maintenance durations for such wind turbines will develop compared to 5 \{MW\} wind turbines. Based on the results of this analysis, it is concluded that higher failure rates and maintenance durations rapidly are counterbalancing the benefits of larger wind turbines. },
