In addition, weather is in this case a major additional risk factor, which plays a meaningful role in the preparation and installation of wind plants at sea. This can lead to extensive project delays of several months. All currently known mounting techniques can only be performed in calm sea. In this context, important criteria are wave height and wind speed. With a significant wave height of more than 1.5 meter and/or wind speed of 17 m/s at 10 meter of altitude, installation and transport of material at sea will generally be stopped, \cite{aitsimulation}.

In parallel, the dimensions and weight of the components involved make the transport and storage of the components difficult. The main transport problems arise with scarce crane capacities and spatially limited transport permit, while storage problems arise when leasing of docks and storage areas are negotiated with port authorities. New large components, e.g. blades of more than 120 meters length, often cannot be transported properly. Sometimes total weight exceeds vehicles capacities.

Novel logistical problems for the control of supply chains arise from the influences of specific parameters like campaign-based planning, short-term scheduling due to meteorological influences and constraints on scarce and costly resources.
