A closer look of the results of the lead times by varying the number of OWTs (Fig xx) considering the winter and summer seasons indicated different increase in lead time when the number of OWT to be installed increased. For example considering the 1st of March (winter) and 1st of July (summer) a starting date of the project ,for lower number of turbines , figure xx indicates that it would be preferable to start the project during winter time but for large number of turbines during summer time or to split in to two phases. The justification about these differences can be supported by the fact that if we start in winter for lower number of turbines, the project could be completed before the next winter appears.
