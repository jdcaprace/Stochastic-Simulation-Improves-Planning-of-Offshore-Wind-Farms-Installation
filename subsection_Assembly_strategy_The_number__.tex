\subsection{Assembly strategies}
The number of lifts at the offshore site depends on the assembly strategy selected. There are mainly three assembly strategies currently used in the offshore wind industry:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Rotor Star (RS) -- It is an installation strategy where three blades and hub will be assembled in the staging area, forming a rotor.
\item Single Blade (SB) -- All the wind turbine parts will be transported to the offshore site and installed one by one.
\item Bunny Ears (BE) -- This type of turbine installation requires having two blades pre-assembled forming bunny ears in the staging area and the last blade will be installed independently at the offshore site.
\end{enumerate}

In this paper, the performance of the three assembly strategies is compared.
