TODO: Redo the figure of the process workflow

Fig. \ref{fig:SimulationModel} presents the DES workflow that includes assembly, transport and storage processes ????????.
Table \ref{tab:times} shows the summary of the mean times of each manufacturing activities that has been implemented in the logistic chain simulation. These activities are stochastic by nature. Hence, Gauss distribution given by equation \ref{eqn:normaldist} have been applied, where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ the standard deviation. The standard deviation has been defined equal to 10\% of the mean time. A sensitivity analysis showed that this parameter is secondary compared to the influence of the metocean data. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:normaldist}
f\left( x \right) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi} } e^{- \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^{2}}
\end{equation}
