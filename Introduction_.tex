\textbf{Gap --}
However, with increasing distances from the shore, higher water depth and rising sizes of the plants, the industry has to face the challenge to develop sustainable installation procedures in order to implement projects in the planned cost and time. Important limiting factors for offshore wind farms installation are the weather conditions and installation strategies. Hence, optimal strategies need to take weather conditions into account.

\textbf{Purpose --}
\textit{The purpose of this paper is to carry out an analysis on the effect of weather condition and installation strategies for the transport and installation of wind turbines at sea. both real historical weather data and probabilistic approaches have been implemented in the analysis.}

This paper describes a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) of offshore wind farms installation using weather dependant transport and installation at sea. both real historical weather data and probabilistic approaches have been implemented in the analysis.
%Methodology - .... results in ....
\textbf{Methodology --}
The stochastic simulation were coupled with a real weather data from a specific offshore site. Whole supply chain have been simulated starting with the manufacturers and ending with the installation of the offshore wind farm.
%Results - We suggest that ..., The results point to the development of ..., These findings provide ...
\textbf{Results --}
The results emphasize the huge risks on the installation time and costs due to stochastic behaviour of weather. 
%Conclusions - We suggest that the
\textbf{Conclusions --}
We suggest that simulations may improve and reduce the risks on the planning activities of offshore wind farms.
