Table \ref{tab:times} shows the summary of the mean times of each single activities that has been implemented in the logistic chain simulation. These activities are stochastic by nature. Hence, normal distribution given by equation \ref{normaldist} have been applied.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:normaldist}
f\left( x \right) = frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi} }
\end{equation}
