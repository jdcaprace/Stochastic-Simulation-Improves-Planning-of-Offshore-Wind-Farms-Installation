Table \ref{tab:times} shows the summary of the mean times of each single activities that has been implemented in the logistic chain simulation. These activities are stochastic by nature. Hence, Gauss distribution given by equation \ref{eqn:normaldist} have been applied, where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ the standard deviation.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:normaldist}
f\left( x \right) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi} } e^{- \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^{2}}
\end{equation}
