\section{Challenges of offshore wind turbines installation}
The challenges of installing offshore wind turbines is due to several factors. Firstly, wind turbine are made up of various large and heavy components that are produced in different sites. Secondly, there are various possible installation scenarios depending on infrastructure and transport vessels availabilities. Thirdly, the installation of the offshore wind turbines is strongly influenced by weather conditions.  
Finally, the material process flow can be affected by various disturbances.
