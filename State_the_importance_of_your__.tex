\textbf{Importance} --
The installation of offshore facilities is very costly and any interruption along its supply chain could cause a big impact on the overall operation. Hence having a well organized transporting and installation system is very crucial for the offshore industry.
However, no tools are available that enable developers to perform a robust multi-criteria simulation to derive comprehensive deployment and installation strategies. To avoid supply chain bottlenecks and to provide an effective decision support tool, an integrated and comprehensive simulation platform of OWFs installation that takes into account weather effects is required.

In consequence, the development of sustainable installation procedures taking into account long distances and special challenges of maritime transport is required. The simulation of different installation strategies can support the planning process and reduce the risks of assembling OWFs. The model should be able to take into account the effects of weather on the installation cycle, to assess the likelihood of delays of a certain process and to propose alternatives to minimize the effects of these delays. By evaluating different sets of weather data, the over-all installation process can be optimized with respect to shortest installation times and highest robustness of the schedule.
