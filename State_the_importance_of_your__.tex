\textbf{Importance} --
The installation of offshore facilities is very costly and any interruption along its supply chain could cause a big impact on the overall operation. Hence having a well-organized transporting and installation system is very crucial for the offshore industry.
However, no tools are available that enable developers to perform a robust multi-criteria simulation to derive comprehensive deployment and installation strategies. To avoid supply chain bottlenecks and to provide an effective decision support tool, an integrated and comprehensive simulation platform of OWFs installation that takes into account weather effects is required. Indeed, the simulation of different installation strategies can support the planning process and reduce the risks of assembling OWFs.
