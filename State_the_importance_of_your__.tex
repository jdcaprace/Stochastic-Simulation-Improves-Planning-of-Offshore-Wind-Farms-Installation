\textbf{Importance} --
In consequence, the development of sustainable installation procedures taking into account long distances and special challenges of maritime transport is required. The simulation of different installation strategies can support the planning process and reduce the risks of assembling OWFs. The model should be able to take into account the effects of weather on the installation cycle, to assess the likelihood of delays of a certain process and to propose alternatives to minimize the effects of these delays. By evaluating different sets of weather data, the over-all installation process can be optimized with respect to shortest installation times and highest robustness of the schedule.

\textbf{Purpose} --
In this paper, a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) of OWFs installation has been developed using weather dependant transport and installation at sea. The originality of the model is to use real offshore weather data in order to quantify accurately the transport and installation risks of an European specific site.Probablistic approach has also been included in the analysis.
