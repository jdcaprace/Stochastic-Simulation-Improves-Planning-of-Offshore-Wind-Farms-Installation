\section{Results and discussion}
\label{results}
To illustrate the developed approaches, a case study of the installation of an OWF located along Belgium coastline on the Thornton bank have been considered. It consist of $60$ OWTs of $5$ MW.
The jacket installation phase will start after $20$ piles have been driven at the offshore site, i.e. the piles for $5$ OWTs, while transport and assembly of topside elements will start after $5$ jacket foundations have been installed and grouted on the seabed.
The following sections compare and discuss the simulation results of the two considered approaches.
