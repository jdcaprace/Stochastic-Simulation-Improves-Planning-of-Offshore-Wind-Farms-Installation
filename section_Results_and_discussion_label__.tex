\section{Results and discussion}
\label{results}
Outputs are evaluated after each iteration of the DES then averaged when all simulations are completed. Since multiple simulations are run in order to cover all possible situations such as good/bad year for environmental conditions, good/bad performances of the assembly processes, etc., the outputs associated with each scenario is varying. By running a sufficiently large number of simulations, the average results ($\mu$) will converge to a final value and the variability across simulations ($\sigma$) will provide a measure of the uncertainty.
%This is required because making decision only by considering one attribute may lead the OWF integrator to wronf decisions. 

This section is dedicated to analyze, compare and discuss the simulation results with the two different approaches developed.
