\section{Results and discussion}
\label{results}
Outputs are evaluated after each iteration of the DES than averaging when all simulations are completed. Since multiple simulations are run in order to cover all possible situations such as good/bas environmental conditions, good/bad performances of the assembly processes, the outputs associated with each scenario is varying. By running a sufficiently large number of simulations, the average results will converge to a final value and the variability across simulations will provide a measure of the uncertainty.

This section is dedicated to analyze, compare and discuss the simulation results with the two different approaches developed.
