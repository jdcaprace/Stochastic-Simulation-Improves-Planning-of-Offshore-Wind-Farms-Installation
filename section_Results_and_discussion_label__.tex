To illustrate the developed approaches, the layout configuration of the Thorntonbank OWF located at 30 km of the Belgian coast (latitude 51° 38′ 39″ North, longitude 2° 55′ 38″ East), in water ranging from 12 to 27 meters deep has been adopted, see Fig \ref{fig:map}.
%To illustrate the developed approaches, a case study of the installation of an OWF located along Belgium coastline on the Thornton bank have been considered. 
It consist of $60$ OWTs of $5$ MW with a hub height over the sea level of $100$ meters.
The jacket installation phase will start after $20$ piles have been driven at the offshore site, i.e. the piles for $5$ OWTs, while transport and assembly of topside elements will start after $5$ jacket foundations have been installed and grouted on the seabed.
The following sections compare and discuss the simulation results of the two considered approaches.
