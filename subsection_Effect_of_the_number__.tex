\subsection{Effect of the number of OWT to be installed}

An attempt has been made to see the effect of increasing the number of OWTs to be installed. Fig. \ref{fig:effectnumber} indicates that the project lead time over the year follows a similar pattern as the number of turbines to be installed increases from 20 to 70. However, the influence of the starting date of the project slightly increase when the number of OWTs to be installed are reduced. It was also found that the increase in lead time for every 10 turbines increment could range from 38 days to 79 days depending on the starting date of the project over the year.
