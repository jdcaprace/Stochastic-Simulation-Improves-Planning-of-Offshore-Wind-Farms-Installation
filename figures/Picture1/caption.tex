Convergence of probabilistic simulation after 400 iterations of the accumulated average lead time measured in days between the start of pilling activity of the first OWT until the completion of an OWF containing 60 units. Results are presented for probabilistic approach and Rotor Star (RS) strategy considering that the starting date of the project is first of March.
