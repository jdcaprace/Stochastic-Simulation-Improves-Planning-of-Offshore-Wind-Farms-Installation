Fig xx Effect of varying the number of OWT and the starting dates (seasons) on the mean lead time ($\mu$) of the installation measured in days between the start of pilling activity of the first OWT until the completion of the OWF. Simulation results are plotted for the probabilistic approach considering 400 iterations.
