Influence of the starting date of the project on the mean lead time ($\mu$) of the installation of 60 OWT measured in days between the start of pilling activity of the first OWT until the completion of an OWF containing 60 units. Simulation results are computed using the wind speed and wave height time series from 1995 to 2006. Shaded areas show the standard deviation limits ($\sigma$), i.e. $\mu + \sigma$ and $\mu - \sigma$.
