Influence of the starting date of the project on the mean lead time ($\mu$) of the installation of 60 OWT measured in days between the start of pilling activity of the first OWT until the completion of an OWF containing 60 units. Simulation results are compared for historical model and probabilistic approach. Shaded areas show the standard deviation limits for both models, i.e. $\mu + \sigma$ and $\mu - \sigma$.
