Influence of the starting date of the project on the mean lead time ($\mu$) of the installation of 60 OWTs measured in days. Simulation results are compared for deterministic and probabilistic approach for Rotor Star (RS) strategy. Shaded areas show the standard deviation limits ($\sigma$) for both models, i.e. $\mu + \sigma$ and $\mu - \sigma$.
