\subsection{Resources}
Transportation processes involve vessels and vehicles that were respectively modelled with constant speeds and travelling distance between origins and destinations through distance matrix. Tab. \ref{tab:ressources} give a summary of the quantities, capacities, operational speeds and weather limits of the principal transport resources used in the model. Additionally, storage processes were modelled defining limited storage capacities.
