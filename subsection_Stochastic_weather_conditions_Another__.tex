\subsection{Stochastic weather conditions}
Another aspect concerns the effects of weather uncertainties that have a major importance upon the process of installation of OFTs, \cite{COMPIT11}. For instance, the jacking process of an offshore vessel can only be executed up to a certain wave height and wind speed. At the moment, the offshore companies plan to install the foundations between autumn and spring, and to assemble the nacelles and rotors during the summer. Because of the seasonal weather changes, it is hard to predict the efficiency and associated risks of the installation strategies.

Weather predictions and numerical weather forecasts can be calculated with different models. However, the reliable weather predictions are mostly provided for a period of approximately a maximum of 14 days, \cite{hinnenthal2007}. This is obviously not appropriated for a long-term scheduling.

Weather restrictions can be defined for resources and processes in the model. For example, seagoing specialized vessels like jack-up barges or other installation units are characterized by weather constraints, see Table \ref{TableWorkability}. Depending on wind force or wave height, or both, the vessel might not be allowed to leave the port and start its journey to the OWF although the loading process is completed. Having arrived at its destination at sea, processes like the installation of each component of a wind turbine can be delayed too.

Additionally to these criteria, a "time window" concept was defined for the utilization of the resources. It is defined by the amount of time in which the weather parameters will allow the process to occur under safe weather conditions. This time window was implemented for each transport resource shown in Table \ref{TableWorkability}.

A "workability" criterion has been defined for each resources based on measured weather data and criteria defined in Table \ref{TableWorkability}. This parameter verifies whether or not an activity can be started at a certain date. If the weather parameter (wind speed or wave height) doesn't exceed the working limits during the defined time window, the activity can be started. Otherwise, the activity will be delayed until favourable weather conditions are appearing.
